## Project Description

**Be New** is a web application designed to simplify and standardize the employee onboarding process within organizations. The system provides centralized management of onboarding checklists, visibility of progress for managers, and complete control over task templates for administrators. The product is delivered as a SaaS solution running in a browser with secure authentication and granular role-based access control.

### Key Features

- **Checklist Templates**: Create, edit, and manage templates assigned to specific positions with versioning support
- **Automated Onboarding**: Automatic checklist generation when a new employee account is created
- **Manager Dashboard**: Overview of assigned employees with progress tracking and search functionality
- **Progress Tracking**: Visual progress bar and task completion status for both managers and employees
- **Security**: Session-based authentication with 30-minute timeout and role-based authorization

### User Roles

- **Administrator**: Full system access, manages users and templates
- **Manager**: Oversees assigned employees, tracks progress, and manages onboarding processes
- **User**: Views and completes assigned onboarding tasks

## Tech Stack

### Frontend

- **Angular 20**: Modern web framework with standalone components and signals
- **TypeScript 5**: Static typing for improved development experience
- **Angular Material**: Pre-built UI components for consistent design
- **CSS**: Custom styling

### Backend

- **Spring Boot 3.5.7**: Enterprise-grade Java framework
- **Java 25**: Latest Java version with modern language features
- **Spring Security**: Authentication and authorization
- **Spring Data JPA**: Database access and ORM
- **PostgreSQL 16**: Production database (planned)
- **H2 Database**: In-memory database for development and testing

### Build & Development Tools

- **Maven**: Multi-module project management and dependency resolution
- **Node.js v22.21.1**: JavaScript runtime for frontend build
- **Frontend Maven Plugin**: Integration of Angular build into Maven lifecycle
- **GitHub Actions**: CI/CD pipeline automation

## Getting Started Locally

### Prerequisites

- **Java 25** or higher
- **Maven 3.6+**
- **Node.js 22.21.1** (will be installed automatically by Maven)
- **PostgreSQL 16** (for production setup)

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/be-new.git
cd be-new
```

2. **Build the entire project**
```bash
mvn clean install
```

This command will:
- Install Node.js and npm automatically in the `benew-frontend/target` directory
- Install frontend dependencies
- Build the Angular application
- Package the frontend into a JAR file
- Build the backend services
- Integrate the frontend with the backend

3. **Run the application**
```bash
cd benew-services
mvn spring-boot:run
```

Alternatively, run the packaged JAR:
```bash
java -jar benew-services/target/benew-services-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

4. **Access the application**

Open your browser and navigate to:
```
http://localhost:8080
```

### Development Mode

For frontend development with hot reload:

```bash
cd benew-frontend
npm install
npm start
```

The Angular development server will start at `http://localhost:4200`
